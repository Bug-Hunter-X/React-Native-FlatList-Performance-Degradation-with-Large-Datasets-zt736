This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The performance becomes extremely slow, and the app may freeze or crash. This is often due to inefficient rendering or data handling.  The issue might be exacerbated by improperly handled keys, complex item render functions, or a lack of optimization techniques like `getItemLayout` or `windowSize`.  In this example, a very large array is rendered without these optimizations.
